### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently polishing my Python programming skills.
I have a fair background in electronics and like to play around with Arduino hardware.

Fun Fact: Penguins only live in the south pole (Antarctica) and not the north pole. That does not make any sense since the south pole is freaking freezing!
